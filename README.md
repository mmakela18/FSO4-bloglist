Problem: dotenv seemingly doesn't load .env

Attempted solution: do over 30 minutes of research on why dotenv doesn't work

Actual solution: put on glasses and see that MONDODB_URI =/= MONGODB_URI

Also learned that dotenv won't override local environment variables.
So defining PORT in ~/.bashrc in previous exercise was a mistake. :(
